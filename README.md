## 💡 How It Works

1. The app uses Tkinter’s Button, Entry, and Label widgets to create the calculator layout.

2. Each button is linked to a callback function that updates the display or performs calculations.

3. The eval() function (or a custom parser) computes expressions dynamically.

4. The result is displayed in the entry widget in real-time.
